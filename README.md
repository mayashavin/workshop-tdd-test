# TDD Workshop 101 - React & Azure Functions

This repo is a workshop for TDD testing for both Backend and Frontend. It is a simple serverless web app that contains a few serverless API endpoints built with Azure Serverless Functions, and the UI built using React.

Each branch in this repo represents a step in the workshop. The master branch is the starting point and each subsequent branch builds on the previous one.

Good luck!
